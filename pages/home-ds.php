    <h2>Welcome to Skyhook</h2>
    <p>
      The place to store all your notes and to retrieve them very quickly.
    </p><p>
      This handy utility allows copying and pasting text and saving online.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find any text select the search page and type in a couple of characters and all records will rapidly appear.
    </p><p>
      Records can be added or amended but cannot be deleted!
    </p><p>
      It is necessary to create an account to be able to add, amend and search records.
    </p><p>
      A <samp>test</samp> username with <samp>test</samp> as the password may be used to test functionality - please do not abuse this feature!
    </p><p>
      I would be grateful for all feedback, problems and especially improvements.
    </p><p>
      The utility is strictly for my own usage and curious if any others would find it useful. If so I will endeavor to register a new domain and provide a link.
    </p><p>
      If on the off-chance this utility could be useful to others then I would be grateful for suggestions for a suitable domain name.
